            <strong>Be a Responsible Owner:</strong>
            As the vehicle’s owner, you are responsible
            for the safe and proper operation
            of your motorcycle.
            Motorcycles are single-track vehicles.
            Their safe use and operation are dependent
            upon the use of proper riding
            techniques as well as the expertise of
            the operator. Every operator should
            know the following requirements before
            riding this motorcycle.
            He or she should:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Obtain thorough instructions from
a competent source on all aspects
of motorcycle operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Observe the warnings and maintenance
requirements in this Owner’s
Manual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Obtain qualified training in safe
and proper riding techniques.
              </li>
              <li>
                Obtain professional technical service
as indicated in this Owner’s
Manual and/or when made necessary
by mechanical conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Never operate a motorcycle without
proper training or instruction.
Take a training course. Beginners
should receive training from a certified
instructor. Contact an authorized
motorcycle dealer to find out
about the training courses nearest
you.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Safe Riding:</strong>
Perform the pre-operation checks
each time you use the vehicle to make
sure it is in safe operating condition.
Failure to inspect or maintain the vehicle
properly increases the possibility of
an accident or equipment damage.
<ul>
  <li>
    This motorcycle is designed to
carry the operator and a passenger.
  </li>
  <li>
    The failure of motorists to detect
and recognize motorcycles in traffic
is the predominating cause of
automobile/motorcycle accidents.
Many accidents have been
caused by an automobile driver
who did not see the motorcycle.
Making yourself conspicuous appears
to be very effective in reducing
the chance of this type of
accident.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wear a brightly colored jacket.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use extra caution when you are
approaching and passing
through intersections, since intersections
are the most likely
places for motorcycle accidents
to occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ride where other motorists can
see you. Avoid riding in another
motorist’s blind spot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never maintain a motorcycle
without proper knowledge.
Contact an authorized motorcycle
dealer to inform you on basic
motorcycle maintenance.
Certain maintenance can only
be carried out by certified staff.
  </li>
</ul>
        </p>
<p>
  <strong>Protective Apparel:</strong>The majority of fatalities from motorcycle
  accidents are the result of head injuries.
  The use of a safety helmet is the
  single most critical factor in the prevention
  or reduction of head injuries.
    <ul>
      <li>Always wear an approved helmet.</li>
      <li>Wear a face shield or goggles.
        Wind in your unprotected eyes
        could contribute to an impairment
        of vision that could delay seeing a
        hazard.</li>
        <li>The use of a jacket, heavy boots,
          trousers, gloves, etc., is effective
          in preventing or reducing abrasions
          or lacerations.</li>
          <li>Never wear loose-fitting clothes,
            otherwise they could catch on the
            control levers, footrests, or wheels
            and cause injury or an accident.</li>
          <li>Always wear protective clothing
            that covers your legs, ankles, and
            feet. The engine or exhaust system
            become very hot during or after
            operation and can cause
            burns.</li>
          <li>A passenger should also observe
            the above precautions.</li>
