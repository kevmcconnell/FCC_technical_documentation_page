          <p>
            <strong>Be a Responsible Owner:</strong>
            As the vehicle’s owner, you are responsible
            for the safe and proper operation
            of your motorcycle.
            Motorcycles are single-track vehicles.
            Their safe use and operation are dependent
            upon the use of proper riding
            techniques as well as the expertise of
            the operator. Every operator should
            know the following requirements before
            riding this motorcycle.
            He or she should:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Obtain thorough instructions from
a competent source on all aspects
of motorcycle operation.
              </li>
              <li>
                Observe the warnings and maintenance
requirements in this Owner’s
Manual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Obtain qualified training in safe
and proper riding techniques.
              </li>
              <li>
                Obtain professional technical service
as indicated in this Owner’s
Manual and/or when made necessary
by mechanical conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Never operate a motorcycle without
proper training or instruction.
Take a training course. Beginners
should receive training from a certified
instructor. Contact an authorized
motorcycle dealer to find out
about the training courses nearest
you.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Safe Riding:</strong>
Perform the pre-operation checks
each time you use the vehicle to make
sure it is in safe operating condition.
Failure to inspect or maintain the vehicle
properly increases the possibility of
an accident or equipment damage.
<ul>
  <li>
    This motorcycle is designed to
carry the operator and a passenger.
  </li>
  <li>
    The failure of motorists to detect
and recognize motorcycles in traffic
is the predominating cause of
automobile/motorcycle accidents.
Many accidents have been
caused by an automobile driver
who did not see the motorcycle.
Making yourself conspicuous appears
to be very effective in reducing
the chance of this type of
accident.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wear a brightly colored jacket.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use extra caution when you are
approaching and passing
through intersections, since intersections
are the most likely
places for motorcycle accidents
to occur.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ride where other motorists can
see you. Avoid riding in another
motorist’s blind spot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Never maintain a motorcycle
without proper knowledge.
Contact an authorized motorcycle
dealer to inform you on basic
motorcycle maintenance.
Certain maintenance can only
be carried out by certified staff.
  </li>
</ul>
        </p>
<p>
  <strong>Protective Apparel:</strong>The majority of fatalities from motorcycle
  accidents are the result of head injuries.
  The use of a safety helmet is the
  single most critical factor in the prevention
  or reduction of head injuries.
    <ul>
      <li>Always wear an approved helmet.</li>
      <li>Wear a face shield or goggles.
        Wind in your unprotected eyes
        could contribute to an impairment
        of vision that could delay seeing a
        hazard.</li>
        <li>The use of a jacket, heavy boots,
          trousers, gloves, etc., is effective
          in preventing or reducing abrasions
          or lacerations.</li>
          <li>Never wear loose-fitting clothes,
            otherwise they could catch on the
            control levers, footrests, or wheels
            and cause injury or an accident.</li>
          <li>Always wear protective clothing
            that covers your legs, ankles, and
            feet. The engine or exhaust system
            become very hot during or after
            operation and can cause
            burns.</li>
          <li>A passenger should also observe
            the above precautions.</li>

      <p><strong>Starting the engine</strong></p>
      <p>In order for the ignition circuit cut-off
        system to enable starting, one of the
        following conditions must be met:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The transmission is in the neutral
position.
            </li>
            <li>
              The transmission is in gear with
the clutch lever pulled and the
sidestand up.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Turn the key to “ON” and make
sure that the start/engine stop
switch is set to “ON”.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shift the transmission into the
neutral position. The neutral indicator
light should come on. If not,
ask a Yamaha dealer to check the
electrical circuit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start the engine by pushing
the “ON” side of the start/engine
stop switch.
If the engine fails to start, release
the start/engine stop switch, wait
a few seconds, and then try again.
Each starting attempt should be
as short as possible to preserve
the battery. Do not crank the engine
more than 10 seconds on any
one attempt.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the recommended shift points
shown in the following table, close
the throttle, and at the same time,
quickly pull the clutch lever in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shift the transmission into second
gear. (Make sure not to shift the
transmission into the neutral position.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the throttle part way and
gradually release the clutch lever.
          </li>
          <li>Follow the same procedure when
            shifting to the next higher gear.</li>

  <header>Periodic Maintenance and Adjustment</header>
  <article>
    <p><strong>Checking the spark plugs</strong></p>
    <p>The spark plugs are important engine
      components, which should be
      checked periodically, preferably by a
      Yamaha dealer. Since heat and deposits
      will cause any spark plug to slowly
      erode, they should be removed and
      checked in accordance with the periodic
      maintenance and lubrication
      chart. In addition, the condition of the
      spark plugs can reveal the condition of
      the engine.
      The porcelain insulator around the
      center electrode of each spark plug
      should be a medium-to-light tan (the
      ideal color when the vehicle is ridden
      normally), and all spark plugs installed
      in the engine should have the same
      color. If any spark plug shows a distinctly
      different color, the engine could
      be operating improperly. Do not attempt
      to diagnose such problems
      yourself. Instead, have a Yamaha dealer
      check the vehicle.
      If a spark plug shows signs of electrode
      erosion and excessive carbon or
      other deposits, it should be replaced.</p>
      <p><strong>Engin oil and oil filter cartridge</strong></p>
      <p>The engine oil level should be checked
        before each ride. In addition, the oil
        must be changed and the oil filter cartridge
        replaced at the intervals specified
        in the periodic maintenance and
        lubrication chart.</p>
        <p><strong>Coolant</strong></p>
        <p>The coolant level should be checked
          before each ride. In addition, the coolant
          must be changed at the intervals
          specified in the periodic maintenance
          and lubrication chart.</p>
          <p><strong>Tires</strong></p>
          <p>Tires are the only contact between the
            vehicle and the road. Safety in all conditions
            of riding depends on a relatively
            small area of road contact. Therefore, it
            is essential to maintain the tires in good
            condition at all times and replace them
            at the appropriate time with the specified
            tires.</p>

  <header>Motorcycle Care and Storage</header>
    <p><strong>care</strong></p>
    <p>
      While the open design of a motorcycle
reveals the attractiveness of the technology,
it also makes it more vulnerable.
Rust and corrosion can develop
even if high-quality components are
used. A rusty exhaust pipe may go unnoticed
on a car, however, it detracts
from the overall appearance of a motorcycle.
Frequent and proper care
does not only comply with the terms of
the warranty, but it will also keep your
motorcycle looking good, extend its
life and optimize its performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid using strong acidic wheel
          cleaners, especially on spoked
          wheels. If such products are
          used on hard-to-remove dirt, do
          not leave the cleaner on the affected
          area any longer than instructed.
          Also, thoroughly rinse
          the area off with water, immediately
          dry it, and then apply a corrosion
          protection spray.</li>
        <li>Improper cleaning can damage
          plastic parts (such as cowlings,
          panels, windshields, headlight
          lenses, meter lenses, etc.) and
          the mufflers. Use only a soft,
          clean cloth or sponge with water
          to clean plastic. However, if
          the plastic parts cannot be thoroughly
          cleaned with water, diluted
          mild detergent with water
          may be used. Be sure to rinse off any detergent residue using
          plenty of water, as it is harmful
          to plastic parts.</li>
        <li>Do not use any harsh chemical
          products on plastic parts. Be
          sure to avoid using cloths or
          sponges which have been in
          contact with strong or abrasive
          cleaning products, solvent or
          thinner, fuel (gasoline), rust removers
          or inhibitors, brake fluid,
          antifreeze or electrolyte.</li>
        <li>Do not use high-pressure washers
          or steam-jet cleaners since
          they cause water seepage and
          deterioration in the following areas:
          seals (of wheel and swingarm
          bearings, fork and brakes),
          electric components (couplers,
          connectors, instruments,
          switches and lights), breather
          hoses and vents.</li>
        <li>For motorcycles equipped with
          a windshield: Do not use strong
          cleaners or hard sponges as
          they will cause dulling or
          scratching. Some cleaning
          compounds for plastic may
          leave scratches on the windshield.</li>
        <li>Make sure that there is no oil or
          wax on the brakes or tires.</li>
        <li>If necessary, clean the brake
          discs and brake linings with a
          regular brake disc cleaner or
          acetone, and wash the tires with
          warm water and a mild detergent.
          Before riding at higher
          speeds, test the motorcycle’s
          braking performance and cornering
          behavior.</li>
        <li>Apply spray oil and wax sparingly
          and make sure to wipe off
          any excess.</li>
        <li>Never apply oil or wax to any
          rubber and plastic parts, but
          treat them with a suitable care
          product.</li>
        <li>Avoid using abrasive polishing
          compounds as they will wear
          away the paint.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
    <p>
      <ul>Always store your motorcycle in a cool,
        dry place and, if necessary, protect it
        against dust with a porous cover. Be
        sure the engine and the exhaust system
        are cool before covering the motorcycle.</ul>
      <ul>Storing the motorcycle in a
        poorly ventilated room or covering
        it with a tarp, while it is still
        wet, will allow water and humidity
        to seep in and cause rust.</ul>
      <ul>To prevent corrosion, avoid
        damp cellars, stables (because
        of the presence of ammonia)
        and areas where strong chemicals
        are stored.</ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Long Term Storage</strong></p>
    <p>Before storing your motorcycle for several
      months:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Follow all the instructions in the
“Care” section of this chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill up the fuel tank and add fuel
stabilizer (if available) to prevent
the fuel tank from rusting and the
fuel from deteriorating.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lubricate all control cables and
          the pivoting points of all levers and
          pedals as well as of the sidestand/
          centerstand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check and, if necessary, correct
the tire air pressure, and then lift
the motorcycle so that both of its
wheels are off the ground. Alternatively,
turn the wheels a little every
month in order to prevent the tires
from becoming degraded in one
spot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the muffler outlet with a
plastic bag to prevent moisture
from entering it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the battery and fully
charge it. Store it in a cool, dry
place and charge it once a month.
Do not store the battery in an excessively
cold or warm place
